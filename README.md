##### `Hentoid` is a Doujinshi & H-Manga archiving app originally designed to work with:
###### [FAKKU](http://fakku.net/), [Pururin](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/blob/master/repo/assets/img/pururin.jpg) and [Hitomi](http://hitomi.la/).
###### [nhentai](http://nhentai.net/) support was recently added after FAKKU going legit, and Pururin getting abandoned.
###### [tsumino](http://tsumino.com/) support is in as well, after many requests from the community.
##### Check out the [Getting Started with Hentoid](https://github.com/csaki/Hentoid/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Hentoid) guide if you need assistance installing `Hentoid` on your device.
