## Reporting an Issue

* Hendroid uses [GitHub Issue Tracking](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/issues/) to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in Hentoid, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull requests.

* Hendroid also makes uses of [Templates](https://help.github.com/articles/helping-people-contribute-to-your-project/). Whenever you submit an issue, be sure to read the included document and answer any questions before reporting an issue. This will provide the required information needed to prioritize a reported issue.
